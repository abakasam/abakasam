 With all files lost

Using GitPod until get Codeanywhere backup
 They are not providing needed Goto Commands from no longer maintained
  Only could use with File Explorer

Will have to program files again

GitPod Bash breaking

is 50:
    (not blank)         insert line         
    (blank)             add review comment
    REVIEW (Complete)   remove from file
    REVIEW              do nothing
add marker to end of file

concern came with inserting and removing REVIEW 
 is needed to be done
  better to state in the TODO

?
needing to get files off codeanywhere

need to go back to codeanywhere
vscode might be fine with centos

many things broke in other environments
 a lot of files lost
